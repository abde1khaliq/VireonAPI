# Vireon API

A moderation API made with care & love by Abdelkhaliq, built for real-world impact. It leverages AI-driven analysis and detection, designed for scalability and open collaboration.
## Features

- üîç **Moderation**: powered by Gemini for deep content analysis
- üß± **Modular design**: plug-and-play components for flexible integration
- üì¶ **Reproducible setup**: streamlined onboarding and isolated environments
- üß† **Educational tooling**: built for targeted use, not mass deployment
## Run Locally

*Simple and crystal-clear installation*

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bondo2-hub/VireonAPI.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd VireonAPI
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```

Or

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Generate a SECRET_KEY

```bash
cd base/management
python3 generate_secret_key.py
```

- *Store your newly generated key in the `.env` file in the `SECRET_KEY` variable.*

Get your own GEMINI_API_KEY

- Since this project relies on gemini, you'll have to get an API Key and store it in the `env` file in the `GEMINI_API_KEY` variable.

Start the server

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic # Admin & rest_framework static files (css,js)
python manage.py runserver
```

- After all these steps, your server should start with no interruptions or any problems.
## Quick Start (Optional)

I've made a file for quick API Text & image moderation and detection. Just for simple testing

```bash
python -m base.configuration.moderate --text "Your text here"    # Text moderation
python -m base.configuration.moderate --image "Your image_url here" # Image moderation
```

**Results** should be something like this:
```
{
    "violation": true (true or false),
    "harm_type": [profanity] (list of harm types),
    "confidence": 0.97 (float 0 to 1),
    "severity": "moderate",
    "reasoning": string (only include if violation is true),
}
```
## API Reference

#### Text Moderation Endpoint

```http
  POST /v1/analyze/content
```

| Parameter     | Type     | Description                                                                 |
| :------------ | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `api_key`     | `string` | **Required.** Pass as `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` in request header |
| `user_input`  | `string` | **Required.** The text to be moderated |
| `image_url`  | `string` | **Required.** The image to be moderated |

- ‚ö†Ô∏è You must provide either user_input or image_url ‚Äî not both. One is required, both are optional, and mixing them will throw an error.


- üì¢ Vireon is shipped with a built-in interface ‚Äî complete with descriptive documentation, feature previews, and live testing. No guesswork, no setup headaches. Just plug in your key and start moderating.
## FAQ

#### Q: Do I need an API key to use VireonAPI?

Yes. All requests must include your key in the header as:
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

#### Q: Can I send both text and image in one request?

Nope. You must send either user_input (text) or image_url ‚Äî not both.
Each is optional, but one is required to trigger moderation.

#### Q: Is this meant for production use?

Not yet. VireonAPI is built for targeted educational and experimental use, not mass deployment.
It‚Äôs modular, transparent, and open to contributions ‚Äî but not hardened for scale (yet).

#### Q: Can I contribute or customize the pipeline?

Absolutely. The architecture is plug-and-play.
Fork it, tweak it, submit a pull request ‚Äî just keep it modular and testable.
